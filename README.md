# Discrete Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control for determining the optimal inhibitor dose level for an anti-angiogenic therapy based on a mathematical model of tumor growth dynamics.

This repository contains a technical report and the code of an unofficial Matlab R2019b implementation of the strategy presented in the paper: [Toward Cancer Antiangiogenic Therapy: A Strategy for Determining Optimal Inhibitor Dose Level Based on Mathematical Model](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610560) by Bobby Rian Dewangga, Hanung Adi Nugroho, Samiadji Herdjunanto.

This project has been developed during the course of Optimal Control at Sapienza University of Rome.

## Usage

In order to easily reproduce the experiments, you can find a Matlab Live Script file (.mlx) in the main folder. In the MatlabScripts folder all the Matlab (.m) files used for the simulations are provided.
